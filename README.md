# README

Used to search the playlist data from Spotify that I've synced to a local sqlite database.

## TODO

- [ ] export non-`starred` playlists
- [ ] improve matching on sqlite queries so that accented characters match on their unaccented equivalents
- [ ] visualisation of database schema
- [x] create version of `albums.tsv` sorted by artist :: `sorted-albums.tsv`
